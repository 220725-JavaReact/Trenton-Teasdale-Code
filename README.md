Hello, My name is Trenton 
Born and raised in Utah. I knew a little bit of code from high school, but starting last year I started teaching my self to code. I completed a free course online for responsive web development. 
I've made a few small projects, websites for friends, personal websites, and a couple javaScript projects. Happy to have an opportunity to expand my skillset and get paid to learn languages and processes I would have taught myself on my own. 

Interests: I really enjoy painintg, talking about space, i've enjoyed playing around in Photoshop and creating some digital art. I love traveling, writing. I enjoy spending my time playing video games, and playing with my dog Roo.
